 Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

A comprehensive data science project that predicts student academic performance using machine learning. This Flask-based web application analyzes student test scores and provides intelligent insights into overall academic performance.

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow including data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model development, and web application deployment. The system predicts student performance grades based on individual subject scores using a Random Forest regression model.
